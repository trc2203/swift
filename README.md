# swift
The assortment of Python scripts I wrote for testing, data manipulation, investigation and representation for my undergraduate final Physics project. I used data provided by the Swift gamma-ray burst mission and interpolated assuming a log-linear relationship to find the durations over gamma-ray and X-ray portions of the EM spectrum. The aim was to determine whether the data fell into more than the currently accepted two populations of short and long GRBs. Due to the limited amount of data available it was not possible to conclusively determine the existence of a new ultra-long population.
